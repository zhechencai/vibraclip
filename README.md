## 📌 Introduction

VibraCLIP is a multi-modal framework, inspired by the CLIP model [1], that integrates molecular graph representations with infrared (IR) and Raman spectra, from the QM9S Dataset [2] and experimental data, leveraging advanced machine learning to capture complex relationships between molecular structures and vibrational spectroscopy. By aligning these diverse data modalities in a shared representation space, VibraCLIP enables precise molecular identification, bridging the gap between spectral data and molecular interpretation.

## ⚡ Installation
After installing [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/), run the following commands to create a new [environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
named `vibraclip_cpu/gpu` and install the dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f env_gpu.yml
conda activate vibraclip_gpu
pre-commit install
```

> #### WARNING:
> We recommend to use `lightning` instead of the deprecated `pytorch_lightning`, by implementing the changes suggested in the following pull request to `pytorch_geometric` [link](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/10147).

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Generate LMDB file
To generate the `LMDB` file, first you need to place a pickle file in the `data` folder with all the raw information inside. We provide both the pickle file (see supplementary data) and the generation script in the `scripts` folder, so the user can either use our pickle file to re-generate the lmdb file or create a new pickle file from the original QM9S dataset[2].

Then, after getting the pickle file, the user needs to generate the `LMDB` file using the `create_lmdb.py` script as follows:

```python
from vibraclip.preprocessing.graph import QM9Spectra

# Paths
data_path = "./data/qm9s_ir_raman.pkl"
db_path = "./data/qm9s_ir_raman"

# LMDB Generator
extractor = QM9Spectra(
    data_path=data_path,  # Path where the pickle file is placed
    db_path=db_path,      # Path where the LMDB file will be located
    spectra_dim=1750,     # To interpolate both IR and Raman spectra to a given dimension
)

# Run
extractor.get_lmdb()
# extractor.get_pickle()
```

This method automatically generates the molecular graph representations and stores the processed IR and Raman spectra inside the [PyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) `Data` object with other metadata. Finally, the LMDB file is exported in the same `data` folder.

### Training VibraCLIP
To train VibraCLIP, we use [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) to configure the model's hyperparameters and training settings through the `config.yaml` file stored in the `configs` folder. We provide the general configuration file `config.yaml` for pre-training the model and the `config_ft.yaml` for the fine-tuning (realignment) stage with the QM9S external dataset from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and experimental data. We refer the user to check all the hyperparameters used in our work within the yaml files.

### Evaluation
To use the same evaluation method as Spectriever:
```python
python evaluate_retrieval.py --pkl path/to/your/file.pkl

> #### NOTE:
> Please, change the experiment id inside the `config.yaml` file with a lable that tracks your experiments as (e.g., `id: "vibraclip_graph_ir_mass_01"`).
> Also, inside the `paths` the `root_dir` tag should be changed to the path where `vibraclip` is cloned (e.g., `root_dir: "/home/USER/vibraclip"`).

VibraCLIP considers different scenarios for training, depending on the included modalities:

To train VibraCLIP only on the Graph-IR relationship, use the following command:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_ir.py --config-name config.yaml
```

Then, to train VibraCLIP on the Graph-IR-Raman relationships, use the following command:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_ir_raman.py --config-name config.yaml
```

Note that both models can be trained using the same `config.yaml` file.

The model's checkpoint files are stored automatically in the `checkpoints` folder and the `RetrievalAccuracy` callbacks will save a pickle file in the `outputs` folder for further analysis of the model's performance in the test dataset. These outputs can be visualized with the provided `jupyter notebooks` (see Evaluate vibraclip performance section).

We strongly recommend to use [wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/) platform to track the training/validation/testing loss functions during the execution.

> #### NOTE:
> When training starts, a `processed` folder is created inside the `data` directory; if another training is launched, the system will automatically reuse the processed data, and to force reprocessing, simply delete the `processed` folder.

### Hyperparameter Optimization
For `HPO` we use [optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python library to optimize both the model's architecture and the training hyperparameters. Since, VibraCLIP is a multi-modal framework we used a multi-objective strategy optimization where both the validation loss referred to the graph representation and also the validation loss from the spectra. We recommend the user to look at the `main_optuna.py` script before launching an `HPO` experiment.

### Evaluate VibraCLIP performance
We provide two jupyter notebooks, along with the pickle files (see supplementary data section) with all the testing data, in the folder `notebooks` to analyze and visualize the performance of VibraCLIP to get the same plots that are in the publication manuscript.

- `notebooks/vibraclip_metrics.ipynb`: To plot the retrieval accuracy plot of the test set and chemical spaces based on TopK.
- `notebooks/vibraclip_plots.ipynb`: The actual retrieval accuracy plots from the publication for better comparison.

We also include a `notebooks/figures` folder with all the performance and molecular grids from the publication. The `notebooks/outputs` folder is to place the callback pickle files for analysis.

### Makefile
Inside the `Makefile` there are a few handy commands to streamline cleaning tasks.

```bash
make wandb-sync  # In case of using wandb offline

make clean-data  # To remove the processed folder from PyG

make clean-all   # To clean __pycache__ folders and unnecessary things
```

## 💾 Supplementary Data
The supplemetary data has been published in a [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15348391) repository, providing the datasets in both pickle and LMDB formats, the pre-trained `VibraCLIP` checkpoints for all experiments, and the output callback pickle files to ensure full repoducibility of the reported results.

> #### NOTE:
> To reproduce the reported results, the dataset pickle and LMDB files should be placed in the `data` folder, the pre-trained checkpoints in the `pre_trained` folder, and the outputs from the callback can be visualize by placing them within the `notebooks/outputs` folder.
